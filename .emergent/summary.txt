The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application, starting as a pixel-perfect clone of the Kokuai portal. Initial work focused on frontend UI with mock data, including a login page and dashboard. Subsequently, the application was rebranded to Rubio García Dental with specific corporate colors and a custom tooth avatar. A major feature addition was the integration with Google Sheets for appointment data, with a 5-minute auto-sync. The engineer then debugged and fixed several backend API issues related to routing and error handling. Finally, multiple UI/UX refinements were requested by the user, including re-ordering dashboard elements, renaming sections, addressing issues with navigation, and fixing the dark mode and profile editing, which are currently being addressed.

The initial request was to create a pixel-perfect clone of , replicating its design, layout, colors, fonts, images, animations, and responsive behavior. This included a login page with email/password fields, a Forgot password? link, and a dashboard with statistics, recent appointments, and AI assistant activity.

Later, the user requested a complete rebranding to Rubio García Dental. This involved:
- **Branding**: Replacing the Kokuai logo with Rubio García Dental - Implantología y estética de vanguardia, using a dental tooth icon for avatars and branding elements.
- **Color Palette**: Implementing blues, grays, black, and white (e.g., , ) for the corporate identity.
- **Login Page**: Removing the clinic name, keeping only the tooth icon, and changing text to Portal Profesional.
- **User Management**: Setting default credentials (JMD/190582, admin@rubiogarcia.com/dental123), displaying Juan Antonio Manzanedo as Dr. JMD - Director, and using the custom tooth avatar for all users.
- **Dashboard**: Renaming Dashboard to Panel de Control across the app, reordering boxes, and modifying the System Activity box to show a WhatsApp Conversations summary categorized by AI (red/blue).
- **Appointments Section**: Renaming Citas to Agenda, fixing navigation to sub-sections (Calendario, Nueva Cita, Historial), ensuring Google Sheets synchronization, and correcting calendar configuration (start week on Monday).
- **Technical**: Integrating Google Sheets API to synchronize appointment data every 5 minutes from , mapping columns correctly, and ensuring the backend provides real-time data to the frontend.
- **Bug Fixes**: Addressing a Network Error on appointments, fixing the cargando citas loop, correcting the Todas filter, resolving insertBefore Node errors, fixing dark mode, and enabling profile editing.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn UI components for React, Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **State Management**: React hooks (, ),  for notifications.
- **API Integration**: Axios for frontend API calls, FastAPI for backend endpoints.
- **External Integration**: Google Sheets API for data synchronization.
- **Task Scheduling**: Asynchronous background tasks for sheet synchronization (implied by 5-minute update).
- **Routing**: React Router DOM for frontend navigation, FastAPI  for backend.
- **Authentication**: Mock authentication with specific credentials.
- **Error Handling**: Axios interceptors, backend error logging, supervisorctl for service management.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard MERN-like stack structure (MongoDB, Express/FastAPI, React).



**Key Files and Changes:**

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing several reported issues in the Agenda section, specifically:

1.  **Changing Citas to Agenda**: This involved updating the sidebar navigation and page titles throughout the application.
2.  **Fixing the actualizar loop**: This refers to a persistent loading state on the appointments page.
3.  **Making sub-menus functional**: The Calendario, Nueva Cita, and Historial sub-sections within Agenda were not working.
4.  **Ensuring Google Sheets synchronization**: Verifying that appointment data is correctly syncing from Google Sheets.
5.  **Correcting calendar configuration**: The calendar display needs to be fixed, specifically to start the week on Monday.
6.  **Depurating the appointment list**: The list of appointments itself was reportedly mal configurado.

The last action taken by the AI was an edit to the frontend, which likely involved changes to the sidebar navigation () and possibly the  component to address the naming change and the non-functional sub-sections. The user then provided a new list of pending issues, indicating that the previous set of fixes for the Agenda section was incomplete or led to new problems, or that further requests were layered on top.
