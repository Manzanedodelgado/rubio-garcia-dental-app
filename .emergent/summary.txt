The AI engineer successfully established DenApp Control using FastAPI, MongoDB, and React with Shadcn UI. The initial phase involved setting up core modules and authentication. The bulk of the trajectory details an iterative process of implementing and debugging WhatsApp integration via a Node.js Baileys service. Persistent challenges included connection stability (especially on tab changes), displaying message history, synchronizing patient names between WhatsApp and the patient database, and ensuring reliable message sending/receiving. The AI introduced a simple WhatsApp module for stability, implemented auto-scroll, conversation management (delete, new conversation), and addressed dashboard integrations. Despite numerous fixes, the user reported recurring issues, culminating in frustration and a pivot to Google Sheets integration. The previous AI struggled with maintaining bug fixes while adding new features, leading to regressions.

<product_requirements>
The DenApp Control application is a full-stack, responsive web platform for Rubio Garcia Dental clinic. It requires 10 modules: Login, Dashboard, Agenda, Pacientes, WhatsApp, Recordatorios, Plantillas, Automatizaciones, Entrenamiento IA, and Configuraci√≥n. The design mandates an elegant, professional aesthetic adhering to a specific corporate color palette. It must support Admin and Receptionist user roles with granular permissions. Key integrations include WhatsApp Business (using Baileys for messaging, scheduling, colored tags, and AI interaction), and Google Sheets (for Agenda data, with auto-sync every 5 minutes and editable appointment states). The Patients module handles contact management, CSV import, and editable fields. Other modules facilitate mass messaging, custom templates, rule-based automation, AI agent configuration, branding, user management, and backups, all while ensuring autonomy and compliance with LOPD/GDPR.

- ****: The central FastAPI application.
    - *Changes*: Modified for authentication, , and to integrate Google Sheets and WhatsApp (adding , ,  endpoints, static file serving for uploads, and fixing MongoDB ObjectId serialization for dashboard stats).
- ****: Python dependencies.
    - *Changes*: , , ,  were added.
- ****: Defines API endpoints related to WhatsApp functionality.
- ****: Handles communication between FastAPI and the Node.js WhatsApp service.
    - *Changes*: Updated to include logic for message saving, and conditional AI responses.
- ****: Main React component managing routing and layout.
    - *Changes*: Updated to route , and to save the logged-in username to .
- ****: Original complex WhatsApp UI component.
    - *Changes*: Initially received extensive updates for UI, connection logic, message sending, and conversation features. Ultimately replaced by .
- ****: Component for displaying QR code and connection status.
    - *Changes*: Created to handle QR generation and status display, undergoing several iterations to simplify QR rendering.
- ****: New component for WhatsApp business profile and AI settings.
    - *Changes*: Created to manage profile, AI assistant, automated messages, and profile picture upload.
- ****: New dialog component for editing patient details before saving.
    - *Changes*: Created to provide a form for patient data review and editing.
- ****: A simplified version of the WhatsApp UI.
    - *Changes*: Created to ensure stability after recurring connection issues. It focuses on essential functionalities like displaying connection status, real-time message polling, preserving sent messages, auto-scrolling, three ways to open conversations (incoming, existing patient, manual number), and conversation options (delete convo/message). Logic for patient name mapping (handling phone number prefixes) was also added here.
- ****: The core Node.js application for Baileys.
    - *Changes*: Initial setup, minor edits for connection events and logging. Attempts to implement  were reverted due to  loops.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a prolonged bug-fixing cycle for the WhatsApp integration, specifically focusing on critical issues reported by the user. The primary recurring problem was the frontend displaying a disconnected status for WhatsApp, even when the backend service was active and connected, particularly when switching browser tabs. This led to a substantial refactor, discarding the complex  in favor of a new, simplified . This new component aimed to achieve maximum stability by focusing on essential functionalities, implementing  to preserve the connection status for the JMD user, and using client-side polling to maintain a real-time connection status.

After successfully stabilizing the connection (as perceived by the frontend), new bugs were reported, including issues with messages not being displayed, sent messages disappearing from the chat (which was traced to polling overwriting local message state), and the lack of an auto-scroll feature. These were largely addressed. However, just before this summary, the user reported that messages were still not being sent, and the system failed to identify existing contacts when opening a conversation via phone number, particularly due to phone number prefix discrepancies (e.g., 34 prefix in the database vs. no prefix from WhatsApp). The AI was in the process of re-diagnosing the message sending issue when the user expressed significant frustration over recurring bugs and explicitly redirected the task to Google Sheets integration.
