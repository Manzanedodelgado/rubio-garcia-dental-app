The AI engineer successfully initiated the DenApp Control application, prioritizing FastAPI/MongoDB as the backend/database despite initial  inconsistencies. Development progressed iteratively, starting with core UI/UX and authentication, followed by modular expansion. Key steps included  for initial setup and subsequent module creation, along with extensive  usage and manual debugging. Crucial issues like missing Python dependencies (APScheduler) and Node.js library misidentification were resolved. The user's detailed feedback in Chat 35 significantly shaped the application's comprehensive module structure and design. Currently, the application has a functional frontend with all modules structured, and the real-time integrations for WhatsApp (using Baileys via a separate Node.js service) and Google Sheets are actively being implemented, with the WhatsApp service setup in progress.

The goal is to develop DenApp Control, a full-stack, responsive web application for Rubio Garcia Dental clinic. It requires 10 core modules: Login, Dashboard, Agenda, Pacientes, WhatsApp, Recordatorios, Plantillas, Automatizaciones, Entrenamiento IA, and Configuraci√≥n. The aesthetic must be elegant and professional, adhering to the corporate palette (#007AFF, #FFFFFF, #F2F2F7, #8E8E93, #000000) and the clinic's online presence. User roles (Admin: JMD/190582, Receptionist: MGarcia/clinic2024) with granular permissions are essential.

Key integrations include WhatsApp Business (number 664218253, using Baileys library) for messaging, scheduling, colored tags (Urgent, Pending, Resolved), and AI agent interaction. Google Sheets (specific URL, auto-sync every 5 minutes) is for Agenda data, with editable appointment states. Patients module handles contact listing, CSV import, and editable fields. Recordatorios and Plantillas enable mass messaging and custom template creation with variables. Automatizaciones involves rule-based task execution, and Entrenamiento IA configures the AI agent's behavior. Configuration handles branding, user management, and backups. The application aims for autonomy and adherence to LOPD/GDPR.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Integrations:** Baileys (Node.js for WhatsApp), gspread (Python for Google Sheets), httpx (Python for HTTP requests)
- **Scheduling:** APScheduler (Python)
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo structure with distinct frontend, backend, and now a dedicated WhatsApp service directory.



- ****: The core FastAPI application. It defines API routes, handles authentication, and orchestrates calls to various services.
    - *Changes*: Initially set up authentication and basic endpoints. Later, updated to include  for background tasks, and endpoints for Google Sheets and WhatsApp integrations.
- ****: Lists all Python dependencies for the backend.
    - *Changes*: , , , To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

	pip install "fastapi[standard]", , , , , ,  were confirmed.  and  were added.  was added for Google Sheets.  was added for inter-service communication.
- ****: Stores backend environment variables.
    - *Changes*:  was added.
- ****: New file. Contains the logic for interacting with the Google Sheets API using .
- ****: New file. Defines API endpoints related to WhatsApp functionality, which will likely proxy requests to the separate .
- ****: New file. Contains logic for the FastAPI backend to interact with the external Node.js WhatsApp service.
- ****: The main React component that manages application layout, routing, and renders different modules.
    - *Changes*: Initially set up login, dashboard, and patient routes. Progressively updated to include imports and routes for , , , , , , and .
- ****: Global CSS styles, primarily using Tailwind CSS.
    - *Changes*: Updated for professional design, corporate color palette, and responsive adjustments.
- ****: This directory now contains all the individual module components like , , etc. These components handle the UI and specific logic for each feature.
- ****: A newly created directory for a Node.js application dedicated to handling WhatsApp integration using Baileys.
    - ****: New file. Manages Node.js dependencies, specifically  and related packages.
    - ****: New file. This will contain the core logic for the Baileys WhatsApp client, handling QR generation, session management, and message processing.

<pending_tasks>
- Full Google Sheets API integration (requires specific credentials).
- Full WhatsApp integration (requires starting the Node.js service, QR scanning, and session management).
- Implementing complete logic for Recordatorios, Plantillas, Automatizaciones, and Entrenamiento IA modules.
- Implementing the backup and restoration system.
- Further enhancing UI/UX based on specific feedback.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on implementing real external integrations. The  directory has been created, and its  with  dependencies has been initialized and installed. Python  was also installed in the backend to facilitate communication with this new Node.js service. The FastAPI  was updated to include new routes and service logic for both WhatsApp and Google Sheets. The last stated action was to start the  (presumably the  file) and then create an improved React component to display the WhatsApp QR code and connection status to the user, allowing them to link their WhatsApp Business account. This indicates that the backend and a separate Node.js service for WhatsApp are partially configured, and the frontend display for the WhatsApp connection is the next immediate step.
